ETHICSENSE is an advisory toolkit. It is intended to **help identify and  
flag potential ethical risks** in AI systems, but it cannot prove that a  
system is "ethical" or guarantee compliance with any specific law,  
regulation, or industry standard.

- Results may include false positives or false negatives.  
- Ethical risk is **context-dependent** and requires human judgment.  
- ETHICSENSE should be used as **one input** to broader governance,  
  oversight, and compliance processes.  
- Use of ETHICSENSE does not create any warranty or legal guarantee.
