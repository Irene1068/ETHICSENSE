# ETHICSENSE
ETHICSENSE is a toolkit that scans AI products or outputs to assess risks and ethical dimensions: privacy, security, autonomy, bias, inclusiveness, and more—helping teams identify issues before deployment.

## Why ETHICSENSE?
Most responsible AI toolkits are built for technical experts and large organizations, focusing narrowly on statistical fairness or compliance. ETHICSENSE is different. We make ethical AI governance radically accessible for non-technical teams, resource-limited organizations, and anyone committed to human-centered technology. ETHICSENSE puts digital dignity at the heart of every project, going beyond fairness to emphasize autonomy, respect, privacy, and transparency throughout the AI lifecycle. With step-by-step guides, practical templates, and clear communication tools, ETHICSENSE bridges the gap between technical analysis and real-world ethical action—empowering diverse teams to evaluate, document, and improve their AI systems quickly, affordably, and with confidence.

## Business Value
ETHICSENSE delivers concrete value to its users by making ethical AI governance accessible to everyone—not just technical experts. By empowering diverse teams to identify and address ethical risks early, ETHICSENSE helps organizations reduce regulatory and reputational risk, avoid costly compliance consulting, and streamline audit preparation. For example, healthcare startups or small financial firms using ETHICSENSE can save \$20,000–\$50,000 annually on compliance consulting and documentation costs, while reducing exposure to regulatory fines that can easily reach \$250,000 or more per incident (actual figures may vary depending on industry and regulatory environment). Its plain-language tools and templates enable organizations to demonstrate responsible AI practices quickly, earning trust from customers and stakeholders and providing a clear edge in competitive markets where transparency and digital dignity matter most.
## Background
### Problem: 
Many organizations release AI-driven tools without thoroughly assessing ethical risks, leading to harm (bias, privacy breaches, manipulation, discrimination). To the extent that responsible AI is implemented, it focuses on fairness and  bias detection/mitigation, whereas we believe that those must be addressed in the context of broader digital dignity priorities\.  
### How common/frequent: 
Increasingly frequent—AI adoption is outpacing ethical oversight globally.
### Motivation: 
As someone passionate about digital dignity and responsible AI, I see a pressing need for practical, actionable tools to make AI more trustworthy and inclusive.
### Importance: 
Ethical lapses erode trust, cause real harm, and have regulatory, reputational, and financial consequences.

## How It Works
ETHICSENSE will produce a Scorecard for the product assessing the ethical value. [Model Card Template](/model_card_template.md)

## Example Pilot: Healthcare AI Scenario

**Scenario:**  
A regional healthcare provider plans to implement an AI-driven patient risk scoring system to help clinicians prioritize care and predict readmission risk. The team has limited technical staff and no dedicated AI ethics officer, but wants to ensure the system is fair, transparent, and respects patient dignity.

**How ETHICSENSE Adds Value:**  
- **Step 1:** The team uses ETHICSENSE’s plain-language guides to understand key ethical concerns: bias, privacy, transparency, and autonomy.
- **Step 2:** With easy instructions, they run a basic fairness check (e.g., using the “Diabetes 130-US hospitals” dataset) to see if the model predicts differently based on age, gender, or ethnicity.
- **Step 3:** They fill out the Digital Dignity Model Card, documenting data sources, known limitations, and steps taken to mitigate bias and safeguard privacy.
- **Step 4:** The team shares the Model Card with clinicians and patient advocates to gather feedback and build trust.
- **Step 5:** Documentation generated by ETHICSENSE is used for internal review and future regulatory audits, saving an estimated $20,000–$50,000 in compliance and consulting costs, and reducing risk of reputational or legal harm (numbers will vary by organization).

**Why This Matters:**  
By following the ETHICSENSE approach, even a small, resource-limited healthcare team can demonstrate responsible AI use, communicate transparently with patients and stakeholders, and proactively address ethical risks—without needing a team of technical experts.





## Data and AI Techniques
### Data sources:
* Input: AI system specifications, output logs, training datasets, documentation, user feedback.
* External: Databases of known risks or ethical issues, regulatory frameworks.
### Techniques:
* Natural language processing for documentation/code review
* Fairness and bias audits (statistical testing, demographic analysis)
* Privacy risk scoring
* Security checks (e.g., adversarial robustness, data leakage)
* Explainable AI (XAI) for transparency
* Multi-criteria scoring models (possibly using rule-based or supervised learning)
## Demo: 
Analyze outputs from existing open-source AI systems for bias or privacy risk.
### How is it used
* Users: Product managers, AI developers, compliance and ethics teams, auditors, researchers, even regulators.
* Context: During development (“ethics by design”), in pre-deployment review, or as part of an ongoing audit.
* Affected parties: End users, vulnerable groups, society at large, organizations’ brand/reputation.
## Challenges
* Does not solve: All ethical questions are context-dependent;
** tools can flag issues but can’t “prove” ethics.
** May have false negatives/positives.
** Needs ongoing updates as risks and standards evolve.
* Complexity: Many ethical questions lack clear right/wrong answers.
* Adoption: Organizations may resist, fearing slowdowns or unfavorable findings.
* Retrospective implementation of ethical behavior is difficult and expensive. This might serve as a component of or a prototype for a true ethicalAI governance framework that can be implemented from project beginning. 
## What next
* Evolve into an Ethical AI / Digital Dignity Governance framework that can help projects be ethical from conception through execution
* Integrate with development pipelines (CI/CD).
* Add user feedback loops to learn from real-world impacts.
* Partner with standards bodies and regulators.
* Build community-maintained risk libraries and plug-ins for emerging domains (e.g., generative AI, healthcare).
